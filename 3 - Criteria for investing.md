# Important indicators 
*Can bias us for or against investing*
##### Founder(s) and team
+ [Focused](https://also.roybahat.com/lies-we-tell-ourselves-about-focus-75e59e88072d)
+ Combination of human / inhuman, presence of cognitive distortions of founders
+ Spends only when necessary, miserly with capital until the returns are clear
+ Reaction to intense pressure or strong criticism?
+ Differentiated value proposition for talent (e.g., only place to work on a problem, unique founder who is a reason to join the team)
+ Diverse founding team
+ If business shows early signs of success, can founders go the distance?
+ Talking with founders gives us goosebumps

##### Product and market
+ Someone else already tried -- good sign!
+ Clear initial target market, surprisingly narrow, and high on the [gradient of influence](https://also.roybahat.com/picking-your-first-customers-the-gradient-of-influence-47858b90adfd?gi=69834aa51ef2)
+ Clear single metric to focus on now (often engagement or satisfaction)
+ Ignoring the business fashions of the moment
+ Ability to create a #1 service in its market (e.g., network effects, customer lock-in)
+ Could be most important product to its users
+ We have a unique ability to help
+ Clear sense, if applicable, of any direct competitors and why the company has superior offering for its market

##### Business and economics
+ Clear sense of why to raise capital (i.e., where to deploy)
+ [Clear sense of why to raise *venture* capital](https://also.roybahat.com/making-a-financial-model-for-your-early-stage-startup-76630da262a3) (we often discourage founders from taking venture at all)

##### Deal terms
+ Founders own enough of the company
+ Fair ratio between risk and reward?
+ Pro rata rights
+ Information rights, especially to financials
+ Other investors can help the company succeed
+ In success, our eagerness to invest many multiples of our original investment

# Non-negotiable requirements
*Need all of the below*
##### Founder(s) and team
+ Trustworthy (e.g., will tell us when things are even a little broken)
+ Can raise more money or get business to profitability
+ Capable of building a diverse team and an inclusive culture
+ Background check conducted, any issues discussed
+ Can articulate [what they want to prove next](https://also.roybahat.com/instead-of-a-business-plan-write-a-thesis-plan-6de9de59daaf), and why
+ In North America, though [geography still matters](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#geography)

##### Product and market
+ "Makes business work better," without being in financial services
+ We have judgment to identify a winner in the relevant market (i.e., a fit with one of our [stated investment areas](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#themes)) -- and enough confidence in our judgment that, when things go sideways (as they inevitably do in startups) we'll remain devoted investors
+ Unlikely to compete directly with our other portfolio companies (and verified, if in doubt, by the founder(s) in question)

##### Business and economics
+ Plausible to have sustainable unit economics in the future

##### Deal terms
+ Standard investor protections (i.e., liquidity preference at 1x, blocking right over investments that would get repaid before we do)
+ Risk-return work for our fund size (e.g., [typical check size](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#the-numbers), [stage](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#seed))
