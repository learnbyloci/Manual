### Why we exist
We believe ..... Our investor, Kyle Washington., wants to support and understand these changes. ... so we created LOCI. **Below is an overview of what we have learned and aim to discover with many details on how we work.**

LOCI is a seed stage company based in Canada and the US... early product market fit stage company backed by Kyle Washington (https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/person/7381675), founded on a powerful idea that people should be empowered to connect more deeply with their environments and each other. That no one should ever be or feel lost. That smarter people make safer places and when everyone feels safe they are more relaxed and able to be present and feel joy and togetherness. That our phones should be put in our pockets when we arrive. That people can take charge of their own path and route, following their whims, desires and instincts not their turn by turn guidance. , achieving global scale, with a strong and open culture that embraces technology, led by its founders for decades. To serve our founders, we seek — like the rest of Bloomberg — to bring different worlds together (business, technology, culture, the public sector, among others).
